You probably already know from the start that you will have to take the post ID as a route parameter. Now you can directly generate a page for that.\r\n\r\nIs this useful? How do you like the syntax? What about the naming of everything? \r\n\r\nThe new generator cli syntax looks like this\r\n```bash\r\n$ yarn rw g page post {id}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat will give you an entry in your routes like this:\r\n```jsx\r\n<Route path=\"/post/{id}\" page={PostPage} name=\"post\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the generated page will look like this:\r\n```jsx\r\nimport { Link } from '@redwoodjs/router'\r\n\r\nconst PostPage = ({ id }) => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <h1>PostPage</h1>\r\n      <p>Find me in \"./web/src/pages/PostPage/PostPage.js\"</p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        My default route is named \"post\", link to me with `\r\n        <Link to={routes.post({ id: 42 })}>Post 42</Link>`\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>The parameter passed to me is {id}</p>\r\n    </>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default PostPage\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll also get a test that uses a parameter\r\n```jsx\r\nimport { render } from '@redwoodjs/testing'\r\n\r\nimport PostPage from './PostPage'\r\n\r\ndescribe('PostPage', () => {\r\n  it('renders successfully', () => {\r\n    expect(() => {\r\n      render(<PostPage id={42} />)\r\n    }).not.toThrow()\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther supported generator cli syntaxes\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ yarn rw g page post /post/{id}\r\n$ yarn rw g page post {id:Int}\r\n$ yarn rw g page EditPost post/{id}/edit\r\n$ yarn rw g page EditPost post/{id:Int}/edit\r\n```\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Determine if this is something we want to add to RW\r\n- [x] Actually launch/run a project that uses the generated pages\r\n- [x] Run the generated tests\r\n- [x] ~Make sure it handles spaces, like in `yarn rw g page post /post/{ id }`~ We don't want to support this (yargs gives a pretty useful error message if someone tries something like this)\r\n- [x] Update docs https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwoodjs.com/issues/260\r\n- [x] Make sure everything can be destroyed with the `destroy` cli command",

Clicking it sends you to a standalone page that has all-the-things `1.0`.\r\n\r\n![rw-roadmap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32992335/87280525-19d20c00-c4a7-11ea-8436-defdbe1cb923.png)\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that I need this to be extensively cross-checked because it is, using the term as loosely as possible, a spec.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason some of the sections are so short is I just didn't know what to say; didn't know what our plans were. So I'm hoping we can use this page as a way of getting on the same page.\r\n\r\nAlso part of the reason some of the sections are short is I intentionally kept them that way: since I set out to write an overview, I didn't want to make anything tediously long. Basically, deciding on the level of granularity was hard.\r\n\r\nAnd because I wanted to provide an overview, I thought the color-coding (or at least something like it) was super necessary.\r\n\r\n> **History:** at first I tried using Basecamp, since they've got those sweet [Hill Charts](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.4-chapter-12#work-is-like-a-hill)&mdash;great for overviews. But I pretty quickly just figured we'd start with this and if we want to get discussions going around specific todos, we could think about migrating there.\r\n\r\nA few quick points:\r\n\r\n- @cannikin Sorry for what I did to `docutron.js` I can make it less spiky\r\n- @cannikin I pulled the icon from [zondicons](http://www.zondicons.com/) but can make one / make it look more like the others.",

But I feel like adding Tailwind to a Redwood app happens often enough to warrant a generator for it. Let me know if you guys think it's extraneous though. And/or if it should be part of a larger \"css\" generator:\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn rw g css tailwind\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now, adding-directives-to-your-index.css bit is a note at the end, much like the way auth works:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst notes = [\r\n  'Add the following directives to your ./web/src/index.css:',\r\n  '',\r\n  '@tailwind base;',\r\n  '@tailwind components;',\r\n  '@tailwind utilities;',\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI thought this was better than just overwriting `index.css` but open to any suggestions there as well.\r\n\r\n### To-dos:\r\n- [ ] Should this be part of a larger css generator? I.e. just one of many options accessed through `yarn rw g css`\r\n- [ ] Should this output a note about adding directives to `index.css` (current behavior), or just overwrite the file?\r\n- [ ] Add tests!"

The sense of ease you get from doing this is very powerful. Like, \"I want to use TailwindCSS, I know what to do: use a generator to get it set up!\". Some utility generators will do more, some will do less, but if you know to start with a generator, that can show people the \"official\" way to do things and remove any mental roadblocks to getting it done."

Create a new app with `yarn create redwood-app rw-test`.\r\n2. Add `Post` and `User` to `api/prisma/schema.prisma`.\r\n3. Create migration and update: `yarn rw db save` then `yarn rw db up`.\r\n4. Scaffold admin forms for `User` and `Post`: `yarn rw g scaffold user` then `yarn rw g scaffold post`.\r\n5. Make a `User` through the admin form at `http://localhost:8910/users/new`. It should get `id` value `1`.\r\n6. Try to create a post for that user at `http://localhost:8910/posts/new`. When you hit save, you should get the error in the screenshot.\r\n\r\nI'm running macOS Catalina Version 10.15.4.\r\n\r\nps. Love the project!"

Right now, our implementation and approach are inspired by gatsby, wholesale. Relevant links:\r\n- [Accessibility Improvements to Client Side Routing in Gatsby - Available in 2.19.8](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-02-10-accessible-client-side-routing-improvements/)\r\n- [RouteAnnouncer](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/5b15471e793aa16d8e63ad920d0f8c4c4f46052f/packages/gatsby/cache-dir/navigation.js#L161-L208)\r\n\r\nThis first commit just adds a new `RouteAnnouncer` component to `PageLoader` that announces that the page has loaded (by saying \"New page\" + `location.pathname`, which is obviously less than ideal, but just getting started), which was one of the two issues mentioned in #540.\r\n\r\n### Roadmap\r\n- The location of this component will probably change. It should probably be moved up the tree, maybe even wrapping the Router. TBD.\r\n- Focus has to be tackled simultaneously.\r\n\r\n### Short demo\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJXiSsZWVN8"

When I started writing docs, I seemed to be adding tables left and right. So I figured we'd better try to agree on a design up front. But I'm sure we'll still tweak the design slightly as we actually add them to the docs. \r\n\r\nI think [design 3](https://deploy-preview-161--redwoodjs.netlify.app/docs/tables#3-background-header) was a favorite on the last call but @cannikin @thedavidprice @mojombo @peterp what do you guys think?"

I didn't want to open a PR as it's a repo I started from scratch and wasn't sure if a merge comparison would even work right.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1393\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-13 at 11 21 55 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/81849869-0092fa80-950c-11ea-96de-f5901573029c.png\">\r\n\r\nThe site is currently deployed to Netlify here: https://semver.netlify.app/\r\n\r\nAnd the repo is here: https://github.com/cannikin/semver.org\r\n\r\nNetlify will automatically build and deploy whenever a push to master occurs.\r\n\r\nContributions follow the same pattern as the current site: create a directory in `/specs`, add `_locale.md` with the name of your language in the language itself, and then the `v2.0.0.md` (or whatever version). If you want the big blue hero section to appear then you can translate `_hero.html` from the English locale.\r\n\r\nI use a very simple framework that I built, [CameronJS](https://github.com/cannikin/cameronjs) which is just HTML and a couple directives that let you define layouts and partials, pretty simple. Everything is deployed as static HTML with a couple snippets of JS to handle things like the version/language dropdowns and \"Copy to Clipboard\" links. I have a custom build script that parses the Markdown specs and turns them into the requisite HTML."

                "body": "Right now if an auth generator is run multiple times it will add more and more lines of config to `web/src/index.js` which isn't the greatest experience.\r\n\r\n* Should the generator exit with an error if the first insert already exists? Or should it just skip it (with a logged note) and keep going? My first thought is to just skip the step if a quick `match()` says that the line that's going to be inserted is already there, but keep going to the next step.\r\n* What happens if you run two different auth generators, one after the other? My first thought is to check if `<AuthProvider>` already exists and if the `type` doesn't match the generator that's about to run, exit/error and leave a note that the other auth type has already been added.\r\n\r\nOpinions (and PRs) welcome!"

Note that I personally do not have an opinion on this as I have used neither library personally. The two libraries seem roughly equivalently popular based off Google trends and GitHub. The content below is @lookfirst's:\r\n\r\nDigging around and seeing you kind of re-invent wrappers around everything, I can see you unfortunately picked the wrong form library. I dug around for a long time myself and eventually stumbled on [React Final Form](https://final-form.org/react) and it changed everything for me.\r\n\r\nWhile RHF is AWESOME (especially compared with formik) ... it has a fundamental issue, which is that every field has to be registered with a `ref` property, which, as you found, is a little weird... you have to `register` everything. Yuck\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, [React Final Form](https://final-form.org/react) is a lot cleaner (IMHO!). I ended up building a library that integrates [Material UI and RFF](https://github.com/lookfirst/mui-rff), which is kind of similar to your 'wrapper' library, except it includes all the fun form components already! ;-)\r\n\r\nAnyway, keep up the great work... you're obviously on a roll here!"

I didn't want to open a PR as it's a repo I started from scratch and wasn't sure if a merge comparison would even work right.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1393\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-13 at 11 21 55 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/81849869-0092fa80-950c-11ea-96de-f5901573029c.png\">\r\n\r\nThe site is currently deployed to Netlify here: https://semver.netlify.app/\r\n\r\nAnd the repo is here: https://github.com/cannikin/semver.org\r\n\r\nNetlify will automatically build and deploy whenever a push to master occurs.\r\n\r\nContributions follow the same pattern as the current site: create a directory in `/specs`, add `_locale.md` with the name of your language in the language itself, and then the `v2.0.0.md` (or whatever version). If you want the big blue hero section to appear then you can translate `_hero.html` from the English locale.\r\n\r\nI use a very simple framework that I built, [CameronJS](https://github.com/cannikin/cameronjs) which is just HTML and a couple directives that let you define layouts and partials, pretty simple. Everything is deployed as static HTML with a couple snippets of JS to handle things like the version/language dropdowns and \"Copy to Clipboard\" links. I have a custom build script that parses the Markdown specs and turns them into the requisite HTML."

                "body": "OBSERVATION\r\n\r\nRedwood does a great job managing single GraphQL requests on a query --> service --> DB path.  However in a more complex component, or a screen comprised of many components, the single request approach isn't efficient.  Especially with many small components (each with its own GraphQL queries), loading a page could require dozens or hundreds of round-trips from the client to the backend, which can feel slow to the user (leads to a lot of \"Loading\" suspense displays), and require a lot of resource on the server side both at the GraphQL layer (because HTTP connections are expensive) and the database level (many redundant queries + database connections are expensive + whatever Prisma client overhead is required for each query).\r\n\r\nAn app of this kind could require 10-100x the server resources a tailored approach would use.  This is not an issue for toy applications, but is a serious issue for real, scaled applications.\r\n\r\nThese problems are often not noticeable in dev environments.  Unless you do volume / load testing, you won't perceive the end-user slowness nor the server resource demand.  But when you move into production with significant data and number of users, you'll see the problems. \r\n\r\nProblem overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld2_AS4l19g\r\n\r\nSUGGESTION\r\n\r\nConsider adding support for DataLoader batching.  This puts a layer of query batching / lazy loading between the GraphQL query and the Redwood service that delays loading to the next Node.js tick in order to aggregate / rationalize / greatly reduce the number of queries.\r\n\r\nA visualization: https://medium.com/@__xuorig__/the-graphql-dataloader-pattern-visualized-3064a00f319f\r\n\r\nDeep dive from the DataLoader developer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQTnXNCDywA&feature=youtu.be&t=1323\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nThis could be adopted in phases.  The DataLoader services can exist alongside of / or build on top of the existing non-optimized APIs.  The dev can decide if or when to switch to DataLoader.\r\n\r\nYou could make DataLoader part of the normal scaffold generation, or it could be an option.  The scaffolded CRUD screens Redwood provides aren't complex enough to need the loader.\r\n"

                "body": "OBSERVATION\r\n\r\nThe current RedwoodJS data stack (Prisma schema, scaffold, SDL files, GraphQL, services, Prisma, migrations, DB) works well.  Great labor-saver with a lot of intelligent defaults. \r\n\r\nHowever it's not clear how to use this approach if there are multiple, independent DBs.\r\n\r\nNot being able to use >1 physical DBs undershoots one of the main reasons for using GraphQL.\r\n\r\nSCENARIO\r\n\r\nLet's say your app has three distinct data sources:\r\n- main app DB where user data resides (= the current Redwood DB)\r\n- admin DB where topology, licensing, other non-user data resides \r\n- other DBs for other purposes -- history etc. (I'm using AWS QLDB)\r\n\r\nIt would be ideal to support the same treatment for all DBs.\r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE SOLUTION\r\n\r\nMy current approach is to have a separate Redwood app that's 1:1 to each DB (main app, admin app, history app), and expose GraphQL operations for non-main DBs in the main app via custom GraphQL resolvers in the main app.  In other words, three deployments and no Redwood-specific glue.  Classic GraphQL use case: hide the implementation of the underlying service.\r\n\r\nThis works fine in terms of segregating the data and the migrations/etc. that support it.  Not ideal in terms of having a whole app (build cycle, deployment etc.) -- the effort / build resources used at Netlify are 3x what they would be if all the DBs were addressed in some way by 1 app.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThis is a tricky situation overall.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, there SHOULD be a synch between migrations in different DBs -- in my case the user DB and history DB are logically one DB (joint data model) but physically aren't because one is Postgres and the other is AWS QLDB (physical realization / deployment).  For other devs and apps, the practical example could be the separation between app data and auth data, or app-aware data sharding, or something else. These cases MIGHT make sense to manage as two DBs in a single Redwood app if there's a practical way to do that.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, there should NOT be a synch between migrations in different DBs -- in my case, the admin DB has its own timeline -- could migrate the admin DB without migrating the user DB and/or history DB.  These probably do NOT make sense to manage in a single Redwood app.\r\n\r\nQUESTION\r\n\r\nIs there a known-good way to manage >1 DB in a single Redwood app?\r\n\r\nAny general recommendations congruent with the overall Redwood approach that support multiple backend services (including but not limited to DBs) via a single GraphQL server?\r\n\r\n"

Then in your services files, you just import one or both as needed, and use in the normal way. We'd need to scope DB-related CLI commands so you could choose which database to operate on, but that'd be doable.\r\n\r\nFor other types of databases (not using via Prisma), you can certainly just use them via whatever client you normally would, outside of any Redwood integration magic."

It currently takes more exploration than actual code writing, but I'd rather open the PR early on to have a chance to ask questions, and hopefully get the feedback while it's still very little code to review.\r\n\r\nSeveral questions that I have so far:\r\n\r\n1. Probably the biggest concern currently is reusing `files()` from the corresponding `generate` commands. `files()` reads actual files content from disk and renders the templates, which is completely unnecessary for `destroy` command. Should we consider refactoring this and splitting file paths resolving and template rendering into separate functions? It could be done as another issue after the initial version of `destroy` is done.\r\n\r\n2. <details>\r\n      <summary>Do you have a preference which word to use for console messages: \"destroy\", \"delete\" or \"remove\" (expand to see examples)?</summary>\r\n\r\n      - Destroying component files...\r\n      - Removing component files...\r\n      - Deleting component files...\r\n    </details>\r\n\r\n3. After deleting generated files the directory might or might not be empty (users can create files manually). Do you think we should get rid of empty directories as well?\r\n\r\n\r\n4. I find it ambiguous to refer to different types of entities that CLI can generate/destroy as \"components\":\r\n\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/182853/80682029-ce78a600-8ad2-11ea-88fc-d3851af301b6.png)\r\n\r\n    Have you discussed this previously? Did you decide to settle on this term for now?\r\n"
